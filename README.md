Python scripts used to identify the stance of Newscorp's articles on the Voice to Parliament referendum

See the [idea page][idea] for more information.
Or, if you're interested in the scratchpad, see the [Observable notebook][observable]

## Files

- `txt_to_json.py` converts ProQuest .txt files to .json files for easier processing

**Note** The .txt files referenced in the script are not included in this repository.
They are available from The Australian's online archive, but you will need to pay for access.
Your library may have a subscription.
